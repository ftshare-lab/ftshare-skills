`FTShare-skills` is an Agent Skills repository in the FTShare open-source ecosystem. It is designed to organize financial data Skills and investment research workflow Skills.

This repository targets Agent runtimes such as Claude Code, Codex, and OpenClaw. Its goal is to package FTShare financial data capabilities and research workflows into Skills that Agents can understand, call, and reuse, helping Agents move from "calling data" toward "completing research tasks".

## Repository Positioning

`FTShare-skills` is not a single data-interface repository, and it is not the Python SDK.

It carries two categories of capabilities:

1. **Data-level Skills**  
   Wrap FTShare market data, financial data, macro data, index data, ETF data, fund data, Hong Kong and US stock data, news, and related interfaces so that Agents can retrieve structured financial data reliably.

2. **Business-level Skills**  
   Organize data capabilities into investment research workflows such as stock analysis, financial statement interpretation, industry analysis, post-market review, and portfolio analysis, so that Agents can do more than just "fetch data".

The currently available data-level Skill is `FTShare-market-data`. Business-level Skills for real investment research scenarios will be added gradually.

Current notes:

- The root README describes the positioning and structure of the overall Skill repository.
- For installation, usage, parameters, and examples of a specific Skill, read the README in that Skill directory.
- The currently available Skill is `FTShare-market-data`.
- Business-level Skills will be added in future versions.

## Available Skill

### FTShare-market-data

`FTShare-market-data` is the currently available data-level Skill. It allows Agents to call FTShare financial data capabilities.

It covers A-shares, Hong Kong stocks, US stocks, ETFs, funds, indexes, sectors, capital flows, macroeconomic data, financial calendars, news, and related data areas.

For detailed usage, see:

FTShare-market-data/README.md
```

## Planned Business-level Skills

Future directions include:

- Stock analysis Skill
- Financial statement interpretation Skill
- Industry analysis Skill
- Post-market review Skill
- Portfolio analysis Skill
- Event analysis Skill
- Standard research data packages
- Automated report generation workflows for Agents

The goal of business-level Skills is not to expose more raw interfaces, but to organize data, logic, and output structure around real research tasks.

Example:

```text
User: Analyze Kweichow Moutai
    ↓
The business-level Skill decides what data is needed
    ↓
Calls data-level Skills / MCP tools / standard data packages
    ↓
Fetches market data, valuation, financials, shareholders, capital flows, news, and related data
    ↓
Organizes the result into a structured analysis output
```

## Current Stage

This repository is in an early construction stage.

The current focus is to build the data-level Skill, namely `FTShare-market-data`. It provides the underlying data capability for future business-level Skills.

The repository will gradually evolve from "data-level Skills" to "investment research workflow Skills".

## Scope

Please note:

- `FTShare-market-data` is a data-level Skill, not a full research report generator.
- Business-level Skills are still under construction.
- If you need to call data from Python code, use `ftshare-python-sdk`.
- If you need a standard MCP tool entry point, use or wait for `ftshare-mcp`.
- This repository focuses on Agent Skills, not traditional Python packages.
